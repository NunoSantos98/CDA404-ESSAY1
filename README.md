## Background

Many people don't know what it really is, either because of unreliable sources or because of 
Intentional misinformation, leading to a series of <ins> myths about climate change</ins>. This Website contains, I discuss the topic 
from an objective, scientific point of view, discussing the impacts, what's happening and why, response options, and some facts.

## Wire Frames

## Colour choices
The dominant colour was: ![#5DBCD2](https://imgrp2.xiaolee.net/i/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbGFjZWhvbGQuaXQvMTUvMTU4OUYwLzAwMDAwMD90ZXh0PSs=.jpg)`#5DBCD2` because the topic relate cold colours so a blue palette was the right choice.

## Accessibility

To respect the W3C accessibility standarts I tried to turn the website able to use without a mouse because Some people
cannot use a mouse, including many older users with limited fine motor control. An accessible website does not rely on 
the mouse; it makes all functionality available from a keyboard. Then people with disabilities can use assistive technologies
that mimic the keyboard, such as speech input (not included yet).

## Evaluation

* ### To what extent did you tackle the problem that you set out to solve?
The objective of the website is turning easier for everyone who wants to be informed about climate change because nowadays almost everyone 
does not have the patience to search in several sites, they want to find all they want on one website and this website resolves that issue.
* ### What problems did you encounter along the way?
Probably the main problem was the difficulty to find information because there are a lot of sites but the information existed 
are not the most enlightening.
* ### How did you test your website/web-application on multiple devices, and what did you find out?
The method used was the development to the desktop version and after adjusting the website to a mobile version, with the help of "toggle device
toolbar" on Google Chrome and, after this, in the first time testing the mobile version it was possible to know how many elements needed to be adjusted.
* ### What informed your design choices?
The design choice were to create a simple website just displaying what is important because "simple designs should be preferred", so it was used the Ockham's razor principle and displaying in a hierarchy from the left to right using the F-Pattern.
