<p>Climate change is far-reachingly impacting. Climate-related impacts are evident across
     regions and in many sectors that are important to society — such as human health, agriculture 
     and food security, water supply, transportation , energy, ecosystems, and others — and are expected 
     to become increasingly disruptive throughout this century and further.</p>
  
<p>Through more extreme weather events and wildfires, decreased air quality, and diseases transmitted by insects, 
    food and water, climate change affects human health and wellbeing. Agricultural climate changes have risen, and
     are expected to become more serious over this century, a pattern that would undermine the reliability of America's
      food supply.</p>

<p>In some regions, prolonged periods of droughts-related high temperatures contribute to conditions that lead to larger
     wildfires and longer fire seasons. The rising sea level, combined with coastal storms, has increased the risk of erosion,
      storm surge damage and flooding for coastal communities.</p>
